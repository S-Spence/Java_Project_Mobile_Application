# Java Project: Mobile Application
<p>This repository consists of a Java project including Junit tests for test automation. The project contains a contact and a contact service class to create, remove, and update 
contacts from a contact list. The project also has a task and a task service class to create and remove tasks from the mobile application. Finally, the appointment and appointment
service classes create and remove appointments from the appointment list. The project demonstrates several white box and black box testing techniques. Testing helps to ensure the 
code is functional and efficient. Testing also helps ensure the code is secure by applying invalid inputs and verifying error handling. Test automation makes it simpler for 
developers to test their code and identify errors earlier in the development process. Teams can configure CI/CD tools, such as Jenkins, to run tests automatically with each 
software update.</p>
<p>The user requirements guided my development for this software project. I found it was easier to write out the requirements in my test files first and brainstorm the test cases
that would correspond to each requirement. As a developer, thinking of some test cases before writing any code helped me reduce bias in my software tests. I incrementally added
more test cases as I saw fit throughout the development process. I also referenced the requirements document at each phase of development to ensure I did not overlook any software
specifications. The project also includes a summary and reflection paper submitted in my undergraduate course.</p>
